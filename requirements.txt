# requirements inferred from project imports (generated 2025-11-07)
# Primary runtime: streamlit app using scikit-learn for modeling, pandas/numpy for data,
# matplotlib for plotting. scipy is included because scikit-learn's GaussianProcess
# and other internals depend on it.
streamlit>=1.0
scikit-learn>=1.0
pandas>=1.0
numpy>=1.21
matplotlib>=3.0
scipy>=1.7

# Notes:
# - The project uses only the standard library for file I/O/pickling (no extra packages).
# - If you want exact versions from your environment, run `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.
